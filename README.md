Converting data from CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) involves transforming tabular data into a hierarchical structure. Here's an explanation:

### CSV Format:
CSV (Comma-Separated Values): A plain-text format used to represent tabular data, where each line represents a row, and columns within a row are separated by commas (,).
### JSON Format:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): A lightweight data interchange format that represents data objects as key-value pairs and arrays, adhering to a hierarchical structure. It's widely used due to its simplicity and compatibility with various programming languages.
